Other programmers on the other side of the world probably 
made a new Javascript framework when you were sleeping last night. 
We obviously know that separating from the framework is not easy for
a programmer (Although learning new things is the joy of programming).
But it can turn into a nightmare when you think about the codes you
wrote with that old framework. I have those feelings about AngularJS.
