title: Why web components - Part 0

Other programmers on the other side of the world probably 
made a new Javascript framework when you were sleeping last night. 
We obviously know that separating from the framework we are using 
currently is not easy for us (Although learning new things is the joy of programming).
Moreover it can turn into a nightmare when you think about the codes you
wrote with that old framework and planning to migrate to a new framework.
I have those feelings about AngularJS.

## The Curse of AngularJS
When I started working with AngularJS, I felt it is the solution of
the long lasting problem of creating web applications, Which was
struggling with DOM with an unstructured language. Besides other angular
problems, it has a wonderful talent of putting your code into its trap
(I am talking about `$http` and `$scope`). And when you work 3 years
with this framework and start to triumph the success of your projects,
programmers which you read their blogs every day start to insult you with
with these words: performance, isolated scope, $digest, $interpolate etc.

## Dreamming of the new framework
counting the disadvantages of angular and start to search for a new framework
then eveywhere is a new framework!

## Angular and react showed the vision
react: being a library

angular: custom html elements
