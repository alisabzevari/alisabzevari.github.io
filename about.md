Hi,

I am Ali, someone who enjoys experiencing the world with his wife and watching movies beside programming! 
 
Programming for me is like meditation. It helps me focus, free my mind from garbage and love myself! The most interesting part of being a programmer is that you are a member of a society that are always connected to each other around the world and help each other to make the universe a better place to live.
